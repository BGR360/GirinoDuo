# Girino Duo

## NOTICE: This project has been abandoned in a non-working state.

Based on [Cristiano Fontana's "Girino" oscilloscope](http://www.instructables.com/id/Girino-Fast-Arduino-Oscilloscope/). I tweak the source code to my liking
and add a UI for the oscilloscope using Processing.

You can find the original, untampered code on the [`Girino-Original`](https://github.com/BGR360/GirinoDuo/tree/Girino-Original) branch.
